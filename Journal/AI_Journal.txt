Week 1

This week I used AI for trying to find topics specfically for the categories that we are focusing on for the group
project. And for searching something for my friend who is using R Studio for her class and I only briefly touched R over the summer
which was only 5 weeks but I got to learn a little about it. This my chat link for both https://chatgpt.com/c/68c1b764-bb3c-832d-993d-5e5724ae1930
and for the topics https://chatgpt.com/c/68c2fc00-7860-8329-9722-82e943652b8a. 

Week 2

This week I've used chatgpt to help me with a situation that happened recently I wanted to know if it could breakdown
the steps on what to do when someone gets hacked on an app since it happened to my dad so that was what I did with it.

 Week 3
 
 I didn't really use chatgpt this week except I think for asking about a personal matter but I didn't really 
 do much with it. I used claude to debug my code but overall that's it.
